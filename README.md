# Resources
I'd like to thank the following resources for their help with this project. I couldn't have done it without them:

* The [W3C](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center.en.html#block) for helping me center my image at browser widths less than 800 pixels wide.
*  The [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css3_buttons.asp) for refreshing my memory on button styling. 
*  [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16550485/hide-div-tag-on-mobile-view-only) for teaching me how to hide images until the browser reaches a certain width.
*  [The Belchers](http://bobsburgersfox.tumblr.com/), especially Tina, for inspiring me. 

# Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

Somehow, I've got to make an image like this into a clickable hamburger menu button:
